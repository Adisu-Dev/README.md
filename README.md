 Python & SQL Development Portfolio

Welcome to my project repository! This repository contains a collection of Python applications and SQL database implementations designed to solve real-world problems through logic and automation.

🚀 Projects Overview

 1. ATM Simulation System (Python)
An interactive console-based application that mimics the functionality of a real-world Automated Teller Machine.
Authentication: Secure PIN-based login system.
Transactions: Supports balance inquiry, cash deposits, and withdrawals.
Logic: Implements robust error handling to prevent over-drawing and invalid inputs.

 2. Student Grade Calculator (Python & SQL)
A comprehensive tool for academic performance tracking.
Automated Grading: Converts numerical scores into academic grades (A, B, C, etc.) using precise logical scales.
Performance Analysis: Calculates GPA and categorizes student standing (Excellent, Good, Poor).
Dual Implementation: Features both a Python script for quick logic and a SQL Scalar Function for database integration.

 3. Department Placement Database (SQL Server)
A relational database schema designed for university department placements.
Relational Mapping: Tables for Students, Departments, Companies, and Placements.
Business Logic: Includes Stored Procedures for adding students and Triggers to prevent duplicate placements or ineligible entries (based on CGPA).

---

 🛠️ Technical Stack
Languages: Python 3.12.8, T-SQL (MS SQL Server)
Concepts: Procedural Programming, Relational Database Management (RDBMS), Data Validation, and Trigger-based Automation.

 💻 How to Run
1. For Python Scripts:
   - Ensure you have Python installed.
   - Run the command: `python atm_machine.py or python grade_calc.py
2. For SQL Scripts:
   - Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
   - Copy the provided `.sql` files and execute them to build the database and functions.

 📌 Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the ATM project using Tkinter.
- [ ] Connect the Python frontend to the SQL Server backend for persistent data storage.
- [ ] Implement a web-based dashboard for the Placement System.
